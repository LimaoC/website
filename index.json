Many state-of-the-art computer vision models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (Ledig et al., 2017), autoencoders (Dong et al., 2015), and diffusion models (Ho, Jain, and Abbeel, 2020), have been successfully applied to super-resolution tasks. These tasks have applications in many domains, such as medical imaging, computer vision, and satellite imagery (Froede, 2023). In this report, we explore these SOTA models on satellite imagery from the Sentinel-2 and VENμS satellites.\nHigh-resolution satellite imagery can be used for monitoring land cover changes, deforestation, and disaster response, among many other applications (Njambi, 2023). As such, it would be desirable to have a satellite that combines the strengths of both Sentinel-2 and VENμS and captures high-resolution imagery at a global scale. However, deploying a new satellite with these attributes would be costly. Instead, we apply SOTA models to bridge this gap and simulate globally available high-resolution satellite imagery.\nThe SEN2VENμS dataset is an open-data licensed dataset of landscape images (patches) from the Sentinel-2 and VENμS satellites which have been physically aligned and have undergone pre-processing stages. Sentinel-2 has a global range but limited resolution, whereas VENμS has a limited range, but is capable of capturing images at a higher resolution. More specifically, the Sentinel-2 images have a resolution of 128×128 pixels, whereas the VENμS images have a resolution of 256×256 pixels, so our super resolution task has an upscaling factor of two. While there are papers in the literature (Lanaras et al., 2017; Lin and Bioucas-Dias, 2020; Paris, Bioucas-Dias, and Bruzzone, 2017) that have applied super-resolution to imagery from these satellites individually, we will need to use imagery from both satellites to upscale the Sentinel-2 imagery to the resolution capability of VENμS as performed between Sentinel-2 and Rapid-Eye (Galar et al., 2019), which is a fairly novel task for our satellites (Michel et al., 2022).\nExample Images #Below is an example of the imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellite (a), the VENμS satellite (b), a traditional bicubic upscaling method (c), and our three best performing models (d), (e), and (f) applied to the Sentinel-2 image.\n(a) Low resolution (b) Ground truth high resolution (c) Bicubic interpolation (d) Autoencoder (MSE) (e) Autoencoder (Perceptual) (f) SRGAN Links # Report link: pdf GitHub repo: super-resolution-for-satellite-imagery Original dataset paper: https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/7/7/96 Original dataset: https://zenodo.org/records/6514159#.YoRxM5PMK3I ","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/super-resolution-for-satellite-imagery/","section":"Projects","summary":"Super resolution of Sentinel-2 and VENμS satellite imagery","title":"Super Resolution for Satellite Imagery"},{"content":"This is my STAT3007 tutorial paper that I wrote in Semester 1, 2024.\nIn this tutorial paper, we will introduce Nesterov’s Accelerated Gradient Descent (AGD) method, which uses acceleration- and momentum-based concepts to overcome the limitations found in GD. Before doing so, we will cover the GD and classical momentum methods, as these are prerequisite algorithms for AGD, and also serve as algorithms we can compare against AGD.\nLinks # Report link: pdf ","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/nesterov-agd-tute-paper/","section":"Projects","summary":"A tutorial paper on Nesterov\u0026rsquo;s AGD method","title":"Nesterov's Acceleration Gradient Descent Method"},{"content":"This is my COMP4702 project report that I wrote in Semester 1, 2024.

Hangartner and Griffin, 2015). In this report, we investigate one such dataset (Loeschcke, Bundgaard, and Barker, 2000) which has collected various thorax and wing measurements, and focus on the classification of two such species, Aldrichi and Buzzatii, based on these traits.\nLinks # Report link: pdf GitHub repo: drosophila-classification Original dataset: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.k9c31 ","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/drosophila-classification/","section":"Projects","summary":"A classification study of drosophila species\u0026rsquo; thorax and wing traits","title":"Drosophila Classification"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"","title":""},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/julia/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Julia"},{"content":"These projects (and more) can be found on my GitHub page.
