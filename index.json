[{"content":"Many datasets on Australian Drosophila (fruit fly) species have been collated and studied to investigate questions around climate adaptation, species distribution limits, and population genetics (Sandra B. Hangartner and Griffin, 2015). In this report, we investigate one such dataset (Loeschcke, Bundgaard, and Barker, 2000) which has collected various thorax and wing measurements, and focus on the classification of two such species, Aldrichi and Buzzatii, based on these traits.\nReport link: pdf GitHub repo: drosophila-classification Original dataset: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.k9c31 ","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/drosophila-classification/","section":"","summary":"A classification study of drosophila species\u0026rsquo; thorax and wing traits","title":"Drosophila Classification"},{"content":"Experience # Data Analytics Intern, Auto \u0026amp; General, Jun 2023 — Present Innovation Student, Fugro, Nov 2022 — Feb 2023 Pricing Intern, Auto \u0026amp; General, Nov 2021 — Nov 2022 Academic Tutor, Brisbane Grammar School, Feb 2021 — Feb 2022 Teaching Assistant #2024 Semester 1\nCSSE2310: Computer Systems Principles and Programming CSSE3100: Reasoning About Programs STAT2003: Mathematical Probability 2023 Semester 2\nCSSE1001: Introduction to Software Engineering CSSE2310: Computer Systems Principles and Programming MATH2504: Programming of Simulation, Analysis, and Learning Systems 2023 Semester 1\nCSSE1001: Introduction to Software Engineering CSSE2310: Computer Systems Principles and Programming STAT1201: Analysis of Scientific Data 2022 Semester 2\nCSSE1001: Introduction to Software Engineering 2022 Semester 1\nCSSE1001: Introduction to Software Engineering Education # Bachelor of Mathematics (Statistics), University of Queensland, 2021 — Present Bachelor of Computer Science, University of Queensland, 2021 — Present Queensland Certificate of Education, Brisbane Grammar School, 2015 — 2020 Extracurricular # Secretary, UQ Computing Society, 2022 — 2023 Industry Liaison Officer, Mathematics Student Society, 2023 ","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"Experience # Data Analytics Intern, Auto \u0026amp; General, Jun 2023 — Present Innovation Student, Fugro, Nov 2022 — Feb 2023 Pricing Intern, Auto \u0026amp; General, Nov 2021 — Nov 2022 Academic Tutor, Brisbane Grammar School, Feb 2021 — Feb 2022 Teaching Assistant #2024 Semester 1","title":""},{"content":"Projects #These projects (and more) can be found on my GitHub page.
