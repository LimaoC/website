[{"content":"This was my COMP4702 project report in 2024, Semester 1. To read the full report, see Links.\nAbstract #Many datasets on Australian Drosophila (fruit fly) species have been collated and studied to investigate questions around climate adaptation, species distribution limits, and population genetics (Sandra B. Hangartner and Griffin, 2015). In this report, we investigate one such dataset (Loeschcke, Bundgaard, and Barker, 2000) which has collected various thorax and wing measurements, and focus on the classification of two such species, Aldrichi and Buzzatii, based on these traits.\nLinks # Report link: pdf GitHub repo: drosophila-classification Original dataset: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.k9c31 ","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/drosophila-classification/","section":"","summary":"A classification study of drosophila species\u0026rsquo; thorax and wing traits","title":"Drosophila Classification"},{"content":"Experience # Data Analytics Intern, Auto \u0026amp; General, Jun 2023 — Present Innovation Student, Fugro, Nov 2022 — Feb 2023 Pricing Intern, Auto \u0026amp; General, Nov 2021 — Nov 2022 Academic Tutor, Brisbane Grammar School, Feb 2021 — Feb 2022 Teaching Assistant (2022 - Present) # CSSE1001 (Introduction to Software Engineering): 2022 Semester 1, 2022 Semester 2, 2023 Semester 1, 2023 Semester 2 CSSE2310 (Computer Systems Principles and Programming): 2023 Semester 1, 2023 Semester 2, 2024 Semester 1 CSSE3100 (Reasoning About Programs): 2024 Semester 1 MATH2504 (Programming of Simulation, Analysis, and Learning Systems): 2023 Semester 2 STAT1201 (Analysis of Scientific Data): 2023 Semester 1 STAT2003 (Mathematical Probability): 2024 Semester 1 Education # Bachelor of Mathematics (Statistics), University of Queensland, 2021 — Present Bachelor of Computer Science, University of Queensland, 2021 — Present Queensland Certificate of Education, Brisbane Grammar School, 2015 — 2020 Extracurricular # Secretary, UQ Computing Society, 2022 — 2023 Industry Liaison Officer, Mathematics Student Society, 2023 ","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"Experience # Data Analytics Intern, Auto \u0026amp; General, Jun 2023 — Present Innovation Student, Fugro, Nov 2022 — Feb 2023 Pricing Intern, Auto \u0026amp; General, Nov 2021 — Nov 2022 Academic Tutor, Brisbane Grammar School, Feb 2021 — Feb 2022 Teaching Assistant (2022 - Present) # CSSE1001 (Introduction to Software Engineering): 2022 Semester 1, 2022 Semester 2, 2023 Semester 1, 2023 Semester 2 CSSE2310 (Computer Systems Principles and Programming): 2023 Semester 1, 2023 Semester 2, 2024 Semester 1 CSSE3100 (Reasoning About Programs): 2024 Semester 1 MATH2504 (Programming of Simulation, Analysis, and Learning Systems): 2023 Semester 2 STAT1201 (Analysis of Scientific Data): 2023 Semester 1 STAT2003 (Mathematical Probability): 2024 Semester 1 Education # Bachelor of Mathematics (Statistics), University of Queensland, 2021 — Present Bachelor of Computer Science, University of Queensland, 2021 — Present Queensland Certificate of Education, Brisbane Grammar School, 2015 — 2020 Extracurricular # Secretary, UQ Computing Society, 2022 — 2023 Industry Liaison Officer, Mathematics Student Society, 2023 ","title":""},{"content":"Projects #These projects (and more) can be found on my GitHub page.
