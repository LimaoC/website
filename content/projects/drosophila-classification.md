## Abstract

Many datasets on Australian *Drosophila* (fruit fly) species have been collated and studied to investigate questions around climate adaptation, species distribution limits, and population genetics (Sandra B. Hangartner and Griffin, 2015). In this report, we investigate one such dataset (Loeschcke, Bundgaard, and Barker, 2000) which has collected various thorax and wing measurements, and focus on the classification of two such species, *Aldrichi* and *Buzzatii*, based on these traits.
