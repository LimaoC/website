This project implements polynomial arithmetic and polynomial factorization for polynomials with integer coefficients. It has support for using arbitrary-precision integers (`BigInt`s in Julia), working with polynomials modulo a prime number, and computing polynomial multiplication quickly using the Chinese Remainder theorem. This was a [MATH2504](https://courses.smp.uq.edu.au/MATH2504/) project that I worked on in 2022 Semester 2.
