This was my [STAT3007](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=STAT3007) tutorial paper in 2024, Semester 1.

In this tutorial paper, we will introduce Nesterovâ€™s Accelerated Gradient Descent (AGD) method, which uses acceleration- and momentum-based concepts to overcome the limitations found in GD. Before doing so, we will cover the GD and classical momentum methods, as these are prerequisite algorithms for AGD, and also serve as algorithms we can compare against AGD.
